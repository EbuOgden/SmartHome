 The Watson Relationship Extraction service is able to parse sentences into their various components 
 and detect relationships between the components. Relationship Extraction models are domain-specific
 and work best with in-domain input. The service can currently analyze news articles and, based on 
 statistical modeling, the service will perform linguistic analysis of the input text, find spans of 
 text that refers to entities, cluster them together to form entities, and extract the relationships 
 between the entities.
